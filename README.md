# Governor Richard K. Call's letter books viewer
<b>About this project:</b><br/> 
This was the first project I made at Florida Memory. This is a simple research tool built to assist patrons of The State Archives of Florida reference room. The archives have scans of Governor Richard K. Call's letterbooks that are often requested by historians who are studying Florida history. The intent of this project was to build a simple JavaScript tool that can grab the links to these images and organize them so they can be more easily viewed and downloaded. It is now hosted locally on the computers in the reference room.

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/> 
--Javascript<br/>
--HTML<br/>
--CSS<br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/> 
The images were digitized into 32 seperate volumes based on the date written and loaded onto our server. This resulted in over 30,000 images. The most difficult part of this project was determining how to present these without loading thousands of images at once. I ended up creating an image slider that loads a new set of images on arrow click.

<b>Current status:</b><br/> 
The project is complete and is live in the State Archives reference room.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
This application is not part of the Florida Memory website or hosted on the same server. For security reasons, the download feature will only work if the files are present as is the case for the offical version hosted in the State Archives reference area. The full version of this appliction is available to the public.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
This is only hosted locally on desktop computers and is not optimized for smaller screen sizes.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
The files on our server often fail so the images may not always load properly.
