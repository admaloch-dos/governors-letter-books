# Governor Richard K. Call's letter books viewer
<b>About this project:</b><br/>
This was the first project I completed at Florida Memory. This is a simple research tool built to assist patrons of The State Archives of Florida reference room. The archives have scans of Florida Governor Richard K. Call's letterbooks that are often requested by historians who are studying Florida history. The intent of this project was to build a simple JavaScript tool that can grab the links to these images and organize them so they can be more easily viewed and downloaded. It is now hosted locally on the computers in the reference room.

<b>Technologies used:</b><br/>
--<b>Javascript</b><br/>
--<b>HTML</b><br/>
--<b>CSS</b><br/>

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/>
The images were digitized into 32 separate volumes based on the date written, and then loaded onto our server resulting in over 30,000 images. The most difficult part of this project was determining how to present these without loading thousands of images at once. I ended up creating an image slider that loads a new set of images on arrow click.

<b>Current status:</b><br/>
The project is complete and is live in the State Archives reference room.

<b>Note:</b><br/>
This application is not part of the Florida Memory website or hosted on the same server. For security reasons, the download feature will only work if the files are present and they are not present in this github, as is the case for the official version hosted in the State Archives reference area. The full version of this application is available to the public.

<b>Note:</b><br/>
This is hosted locally on desktop computers and is not optimized for smaller screen sizes.

<b>Note:</b><br/>
This project has had issues as there is an extremely high failure rate for files loaded from our servers.
